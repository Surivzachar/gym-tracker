NOTE ABOUT ICONS:

The icon-192.png and icon-512.png files are currently SVG placeholders.

To create proper PNG icons:

Option 1 - Use an online tool:
1. Go to https://www.favicon-generator.org/
2. Upload any image (or create one with the muscle emoji 💪)
3. Generate the icons
4. Download and replace icon-192.png and icon-512.png

Option 2 - Create manually:
1. Open any image editor (Paint, Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)
2. Create a 192x192px image with purple background (#4f46e5)
3. Add the muscle emoji 💪 or any gym-related icon
4. Save as icon-192.png
5. Repeat for 512x512px and save as icon-512.png

Option 3 - Use existing icons:
The app will work fine without proper icons. The icons are only used when
installing the PWA on your home screen. You can update them later.
